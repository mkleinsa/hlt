### Higher-Order Item Response Theory (Latent Trait Theory) with Regression

R package for estimation of higher-order latent trait theory in the context of item response theory. We implement the generalized partial creadit measurent model with a second-order latent trait structure. Latent regression can be done on the second-order latent trait.

   Estimates shared parameter joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event
   (i.e. survival) data. The joint model can be univariate (i.e. one longitudinal
   outcome) or multivariate (i.e. more than one longitudinal outcome). A variety
   of parameterisations are available for linking the longitudinal and event
   processes (i.e. a variety of association structures).
